- [ ] **Implement GET /recipes endpoint** after tests pass
- [ ] **Write tests for GET /recipes/:id endpoint** (recipe details functionality)
- [ ] **Implement GET /recipes/:id endpoint** after tests pass
- [ ] **Write tests for POST /recipes endpoint** (recipe creation)
- [ ] **Implement POST /recipes endpoint** after tests pass

### AI Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Write tests for OCR service integration** (text extraction from images)
- [ ] **Implement OCR service integration** in Python parser service
- [ ] **Write tests for LLM processing service** (structured data extraction from text)
- [ ] **Implement LLM processing service** for recipe structuring

## Lower Priority Advanced Features

### Ingredient Management
- [ ] **Write tests for ingredient linking logic** (canonical ingredient matching/creation)
- [ ] **Implement ingredient linking** and canonical ingredient management
- [ ] **Write tests for ingredient override API** (user corrections to ingredient links)

### Recipe Workflow
- [ ] **Write tests for recipe status management** (processing/review_required/published states)
- [ ] **Write tests for recipe update API** (saving reviewed recipes)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Write end-to-end integration tests** for complete image â†’ structured recipe pipeline

## Notes
- Follow test-first approach: write tests before implementation
- Each checkbox represents a complete, testable unit of work
- Focus on one task at a time, completing tests before moving to implementation
