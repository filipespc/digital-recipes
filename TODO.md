## 📋 DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### Test-First Approach
- **Write tests before implementation** for all new features
- **Test each component individually** before integration
- **Use GUI testing** to verify user-facing functionality
- **Maintain high test coverage** across frontend and backend

### Incremental Delivery
- **Each phase delivers working software** that can be demonstrated
- **Focus on core user workflow** (Save → Find → Decide)
- **Prioritize user-testable features** over internal optimizations
- **Complete one phase before moving to the next**

### Quality Gates
- **All tests must pass** before marking tasks complete
- **Frontend must render correctly** in multiple browsers
- **API endpoints must handle errors gracefully**
- **Database operations must maintain data integrity**

### Current Status: Ready for Phase 1 Implementation
Database and core API foundations are complete. Begin with frontend setup to deliver the first working GUI for recipe viewing.
