# Digital Recipes MVP - Implementation Todo List

## High Priority Foundation

- [x] **Setup project structure** with Go API service and Python parser service directories
- [x] **Create PostgreSQL schema migrations** for users, recipes, canonical_ingredients, recipe_ingredients tables
- [x] **Write database integration tests** for schema validation and basic CRUD operations
- [x] **Implement database connection and migration system** with health checks and pooling
- [x] **Setup development infrastructure** with Docker, Makefile, and automated test runner
- [x] **Configure secure environment management** with .env.example and production-ready settings

## Medium Priority Core APIs

### Recipe Endpoints
- [ ] **Write tests for GET /recipes endpoint** (recipe list functionality)
- [ ] **Implement GET /recipes endpoint** after tests pass
- [ ] **Write tests for GET /recipes/:id endpoint** (recipe details functionality)
- [ ] **Implement GET /recipes/:id endpoint** after tests pass
- [ ] **Write tests for POST /recipes endpoint** (recipe creation)
- [ ] **Implement POST /recipes endpoint** after tests pass

### AI Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Write tests for OCR service integration** (text extraction from images)
- [ ] **Implement OCR service integration** in Python parser service
- [ ] **Write tests for LLM processing service** (structured data extraction from text)
- [ ] **Implement LLM processing service** for recipe structuring

## Lower Priority Advanced Features

### Ingredient Management
- [ ] **Write tests for ingredient linking logic** (canonical ingredient matching/creation)
- [ ] **Implement ingredient linking** and canonical ingredient management
- [ ] **Write tests for ingredient override API** (user corrections to ingredient links)

### Recipe Workflow
- [ ] **Write tests for recipe status management** (processing/review_required/published states)
- [ ] **Write tests for recipe update API** (saving reviewed recipes)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Write end-to-end integration tests** for complete image → structured recipe pipeline

### Database Infrastructure (commits: 14d8038, 65e93ff, 035b1fb)
- ✅ **Complete database schema implementation** with PostgreSQL migrations
- ✅ **Comprehensive database testing infrastructure** with Docker-based test runner
- ✅ **Database connection pooling and health checks** for production readiness  
- ✅ **Migration system** with up/down migrations and seed data
- ✅ **Development tooling** including Makefile targets (db-up, db-down, db-reset, migrate)
- ✅ **Automated test runner** (`run_tests.sh`) with container cleanup
- ✅ **Security hardening** with secure credential management and production configuration

### Foundation Architecture
- ✅ **Decoupled service architecture** with Go API service and Python parser service
- ✅ **Docker containerization** with docker-compose.yml for local development
- ✅ **Environment configuration** with .env.example template
- ✅ **Development documentation** with setup and testing instructions

## Notes
- Follow test-first approach: write tests before implementation
- Each checkbox represents a complete, testable unit of work
- Focus on one task at a time, completing tests before moving to implementation
- **Database foundation is complete** - ready to implement API endpoints
